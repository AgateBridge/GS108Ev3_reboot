This script is for automating the process of rebooting the GS108Ev3 Netgear Switch, which does not have any timer built in for doing so. Users can use a cronjob or another automation tool to reboot this weekly, monthly or as needed. Many Netgear Switches, including most enterprise switches,
do not have this feature. 



Future plans include:

Login credentials in markup text file (XML, Json, etc)
JS rewrite and/or built in web server
Full API, including gathering log information, automating port/VLAN mapping, etc.

Please feel free to use the code! I couldn't find many up to date scripts that still support the Switch with it's current password obfuscation method.
